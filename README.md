# Analytics Project: Movie Schedule Optimization Using Sentimental Analysis of Movie Reviews

* Introduction

  * Traditionally, theaters would predict a high box office for a movie with famous producers, popular cast and high budget and allocate more screenings to these kinds of movies. However, with the spread of SNS and online critics commentaries, people tend to search for comments on the Internet before buying a ticket. As a result, people's comments become more and more important to affect the revenue of a movie.


* Problem Statement and Project Objective

  * Firstly, we would like to understand whether ranking on movie rating websites will affect potential audiences' willingness to watch the movie. If a movie has a high rank, it will attract more audiences to go to the theaters to watch this movie.

  * Second, we decided to formulate a model to analyze audiences' sentiment by their text comments on the Internet. In this way, cinemas can easily gain a quick conclusion from people's comments and make decisions.
